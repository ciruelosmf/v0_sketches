        To fix this element's position at the top of the page, you need to use CSS to position it absolutely or fixed relative to the viewport. Here's how you can achieve that:

 
        <code className=" dark:bg-green-900 py-2  font-light text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-100">
  {codeSnippet}
        </code>
Use fixed position: This will keep the element fixed at the top of the viewport even when you scroll.

Use absolute position: This will position the element at the top of its nearest positioned ancestor (an ancestor with a position other than static).

Here's how you can modify your JSX to use fixed position:

        in a next.js project, is this legit? '''import * as React

        In a Next.js project, it is not necessary to use the * as syntax when importing named exports from a module. 
        The standard and more common way to import named exports is without the * as syntax. 
        Here's the correct and commonly used way to import React and useState:
        Using * as is generally used when you want to import all exports from a module as a single object. 
        However, in this case, since you are importing specific named exports, the syntax above is more appropriate and idiomatic.
        
Here is the corrected version:
If you see this code in your Next.js project:
It is incorrect because useState is not a named export of React when using the * as syntax. Instead, you would need to access useState through the React object:
However, this is not necessary and can be avoided by using the standard import:
Using the standard import is more concise and aligns with common practices in the React and Next.js communities.
